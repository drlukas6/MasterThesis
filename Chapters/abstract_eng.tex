This paper describes the process of image convolution using Cartesian genetic programming (CGP).
Possibilities and performance in evolving image filters are explored.
Results are shown with image denoising filters and edge detection, pointing to the benefits of using CGP.
Unfortunately, synthetic data generation using CGP as an autoencoder does not result in such success.
Various downsides of genetic programming make other, more appropriate deep learning techniques a better choice for some problems.
